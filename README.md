## Installation

This module can be installed in your project using [NPM], [PNPM] or [Yarn]. Make sure, that you use [Node.js] version 6 or newer. Include the versions of `core-js` and `regenerator-runtime`, which you need:

```sh
npm i -D babel-polyfills-generator core-js regenerator-runtime
pnpm i -D babel-polyfills-generator core-js regenerator-runtime
yarn add babel-polyfills-generator core-js regenerator-runtime
```

## Usage

Execute this script during the build of your project. It will generate full and minified scripts including source maps, which you will be able to load on your web page alongside with `@babel/standalone` and the generated `babel-helpers`. Specify the output directory and optionally the base name of the files, for example:

```sh
generate-babel-polyfills dist
```

### Options

    -V, --version           output the version number
    -n, --name <file name>  file name of the generated script (default: "babel-polyfills")
    -h, --help              display help for command

The full and minified files with source maps will be written to the specified
directory. The extension ".js" will be appended to the file name.

### Examples

    $ generate-babel-polyfills dist
    $ generate-babel-polyfills -n polyfills dist
